Q. Difference between checked and unchecked exception?

Exception: In Java “an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of
instructions” is called an exception. This is generally an unexpected or unwanted event which can occur either
at compile-time or run-time in application code.

Checked Exception : occur at compile-time. Classes that directly inherit Throwable - except RuntimeException
and Error - are checked exceptions
Examples:
 IOException
             FileNotFoundException
             SocketException
                    ConnectException
              UnknownHostException
 ReflectiveOperationException
             ClassNotFoundException
             IllegalAccessException
             InstantiationException
             InvocationTargetException
             NoSuchFieldException
 CloneNotSupportException
 InterruptedException


Unchecked Exception : Occur at run-time. Classes that inherit RuntimeException are unchecked exceptions

RunTimeException
                ArithmeticException
                ArrayStoreException
                ClassCostException
                ConcurrentModificationException
                EnumConstantNotPresentException
                IllegalArgumentException
                          IllegalThreadStateException
                          NumberFormatException
                          IllegalMonitorStateException
                IllegalStateException
                IndexOutOfBoundException
                          ArrayIndexOutOfBound
                          StringIndexOutOfBound
                NegativeArraySizeException
                NullPointerException
                SecurityException
                TypeNotPresentException
                UnsupportedOperationException
